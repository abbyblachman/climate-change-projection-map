# climate-change-projection-map

<strong>Climate change projection project</strong>

The goal of this project is to create an application where a user can select a city and see temperature projections by season for that city in future decades based on how much the average temperature will increase due to climate change. 

<em>GIVEN</em> a user who wants to know what their city will look like in future seasons due to climate change, 
<em>WHEN</em> the user enters a city name, 
<em>THEN</em> the application will return a projection of future temperatures by season based on climate change predictions. 

<strong>API</strong>

For this project, we are using an API called <a href="https://api.meteostat.net/">meteostat</a> which gives us current weather projections. API key: ELTLnGss.

There is a 200 calls per API key per hour limit, so if you are working on the project outside of class, you may want to create your own key.
