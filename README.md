# climate-change-projection-map

<strong>Climate change projection project</strong>

The goal of this project is to create an application where a user can select a city and see temperature projections by season for that city in future decades based on how much the average temperature will increase due to climate change. 

<strong>API</strong>

For this project, we are using an API called <a href="https://api.meteostat.net/">meteostat which gives us current weather projections.
